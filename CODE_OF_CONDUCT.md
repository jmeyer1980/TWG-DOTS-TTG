# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the TWG (Tiny Walnut Games) TTG (Terraced Terrain Generation) project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing Unity DOTS/ECS terrain generation technology.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Sharing knowledge about Unity DOTS/ECS, terrain generation, and performance optimization
* Providing helpful code reviews and technical guidance
* Contributing comprehensive tests and documentation
* Maintaining high code quality standards and following established conventions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Submitting low-quality code without adequate testing or documentation
* Ignoring established coding conventions and architectural patterns
* Violating intellectual property rights or licensing terms
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Standards

* **Testing Requirements**: All new features must include comprehensive test coverage. We maintain 154+ tests with 100% pass rate.
* **Documentation**: New systems and significant changes require documentation updates in relevant guides.
* **Performance**: Contributions should maintain or improve performance benchmarks, especially memory usage and frame rates.
* **ECS Conventions**: Follow established ECS patterns and the naming conventions outlined in DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md.
* **Cross-Platform**: Consider compatibility across Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS platforms.

### Code Quality Expectations

* **Memory Management**: Implement proper blob asset cleanup and disposal patterns
* **URP/BRP Compatibility**: Ensure render pipeline compatibility with appropriate fallbacks
* **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling with graceful degradation
* **Runtime Support**: Consider both editor and build environments in implementations

### Collaboration Guidelines

* **Issue Reporting**: Provide clear reproduction steps, Unity version, platform details, and relevant console logs
* **Pull Requests**: Include test coverage, documentation updates, and follow the established review process
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Help others understand Unity DOTS/ECS concepts and terrain generation techniques
* **Respectful Reviews**: Provide constructive technical feedback focused on code improvement

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

This Code of Conduct specifically applies to:

* **Repository Interactions**: Issues, pull requests, discussions, and code reviews
* **Documentation**: README files, guides, API documentation, and inline code comments
* **Testing**: Test contributions, performance benchmarks, and quality assurance
* **Community Support**: Help provided in forums, Discord, or other communication channels
* **Project Presentations**: Talks, demos, or tutorials featuring TTG terrain generation

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
